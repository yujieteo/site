# Agents

1. Read REQUIREMENTS.md. Keep the site to what it says. Prefer deleting to adding.
2. Edit pages in `public/` by hand. No generator, no framework, no build step. The beam page is the
   one exception.
3. Never edit `public/play/beamdiag/index.html`. Change the beam in `beamdiag/`, then run
   `scripts/build-beam.sh` and commit the page with the source.
4. Never change or remove the five URLs in REQUIREMENTS.md: the App Store links to them.
5. Commit to `main`. Turn on the VPN, then run `scripts/deploy.sh`. It runs the check, deploys and
   tests the URLs.
