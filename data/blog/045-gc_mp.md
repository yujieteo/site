This walkthrough follows [Writing a Simple Garbage Collector in C](https://www.maplant.com/2020-04-25-Writing-a-Simple-Garbage-Collector-in-C.html). The author said the code is not necessarily correct. Nevertheless, we will work with what we have. This is a bit out of my depth, but this is a start to roughly know what is important.

The simplest malloc uses a linked list of free blocks of memory that can be split up and given out.

Since we use a linked list, to get out the header, the following is natural, a pointer to next free block, and the unsigned int indicating the size.

## Annotated implementation

```c
typedef struct header {
    unsigned int    size;
    struct header   *next;
} header_t;
/* There is the heap between the stack and uninitialised data or BSS. The heap starts at low address bordering the BSS and ends at program break. Violation is when you access between the stack and the break.
*/
/* This is the base, or a first zero sized block to get us started. */
static header_t base;
/* This is an address pointing to first free block of memory. */
static header_t *freep = &base; 
/* This is an address pointing to first used block of memory. */
static header_t *usedp;         
/*
 * Scan the free list and look for a place to put the block. Basically, we're 
 * looking for any block that the to-be-freed block might have been partitioned from.
 */
static void
add_to_free_list(header_t *bp)
{
    /* This is the pointer that keeps track of where we are looking in the free list.*/
    header_t *p;
    /* The for loop gives a list for the correct place to insert bp.
    Denote bp as the freed memory block. 
    The list remains ordered by the memory addresses.*/
    for (p = freep; !(bp > p && bp < p->next); p = p->next)
        /* This is a like a ring, it wraps around the end of memory,
        p is at the highest address, and p->next is lowest. */
        if (p >= p->next && (bp > p || bp < p->next))
            break;
    /* Read, if bp is adjacent to p->next (bp->size is the size of the block), merge them into a single free block.*/
    if (bp + bp->size == p->next) {
        /* The merge is done here.*/
        bp->size += p->next->size;
        /* Shift this to the next pointer.*/
        bp->next = p->next->next;
        /* Otherwise, just link bp to p->next if there is no adjacency.*/
    } else
        bp->next = p->next;

    /* This is the case where if bp is adjacent to p, merge bp into p*/
    if (p + p->size == bp) {
        p->size += bp->size;
        p->next = bp->next;
    } else
        /* Otherwise, just link bp to p->next. */
        p->next = bp;

    /* Set the free block to the current block p. Update the free list pointer. This improves the efficiency of subsequent allocations and frees.*/
    freep = p;
}

/* We allocate blocks in page sized chunks. */
#define MIN_ALLOC_SIZE 4096 

/*
 Request more memory from the kernel.
 The num_units is the number of header sized units. Returns a pointer to the free list after adding the memory.
 */
static header_t *
morecore(size_t num_units)
{
    void *vp;
    header_t *up;
    /* The intention with this is to make sure an unreasonably large chunk is not requested. This is done by dividing the size of the header, you will see in the next if statement that */
    if (num_units > MIN_ALLOC_SIZE)
        num_units = MIN_ALLOC_SIZE / sizeof(header_t);
    /* Request the memory from the OS using sbrk. If there is a failure, return null.
    Note that modern memory can be allocated in non-contiguous pages. mmap is called instead*/
    if ((vp = sbrk(num_units * sizeof(header_t))) == (void *) -1)
        return NULL;
    /* This converts raw memory into a header_t block called up, the size is set to num_units, then it is added to free list.*/
    up = (header_t *) vp;
    up->size = num_units;
    add_to_free_list (up);
    return freep;
}
/* Naive mark and sweep is used here. (1) Scan all blocks of memory that could point to heap data. For each word size chunk we examine, look at each block in the used list. If the word sized chunk value is in range of the used block, mark it; (2) after searching all possible memory locations, go through the used list and add to the free list all blocks that are not marked. These must be the free blocks.*/
/* Some comments, in C, attempts to access any virtual memory is possible. There is no chunk of memory the compiler can access but has an address that cannot be expressed as an integer and then casted to a pointer. This is unusual compared to other languages. Also, all variables are stored somewhere in memory, memory access is typically word aligned, so just need to check every word (be careful about computer architecture).*/
